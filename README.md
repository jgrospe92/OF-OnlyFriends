# OF-OnlyFriends-app
- A group Project for our mobile application development 2 course

 # Description
- OnlyFriends is a social media platform similar to twitter and onlyFans. Our platform is mainly inspired by OF but instead of posting only explicit content, users posts tutorials, documentations and blogs. The reason why we call it only friends is because a user cannot see another user content without subscribing. This platform encourages creativity and uniqueness.
