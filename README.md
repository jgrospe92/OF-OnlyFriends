# OF-OnlyFriends-app
- A group Project for our mobile application development 2 course

# Project Goal
Our goal is to create a social media platform that allows users to share tutorials, documentations, and blogs with their subscribers and followers. The platform will encourage creativity and uniqueness, and will differentiate itself from competitors by not allowing the posting of explicit content. We want to encourage real talent. The platform will be designed to foster a sense of community and connection among users. A user can support their favorite content creator by subscribing.

# Description
OnlyFriends is a social media platform that allows users to share tutorials, documentations, and blogs with their followers, similar to Twitter. While inspired by OnlyFans, our platform differs in that it does not allow the posting of explicit content. Instead, we encourage creativity and uniqueness among our users. With the same functionality as Twitter, users can easily follow and connect with one another on our platform.
